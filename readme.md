# Learning Concurrency and Parallel Programming

This repo holds some notes and implementations (in Go) for different problems and ideas I came across while learning concurrent and parallel programming, most of these exercices are taken from the very nice book "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Nir Shavit, Maurice Herlihy which I highly recommend to anyone coming across this repo.

Here is a summary of notes and implementations by topic:

## Summary

#### Implementations:

- [The Dining Philosophers Problem - Go Implementation](./dining-philosophers)


#### Notes:
